CSC8639 - Dissertation Project - Context-Aware Load Forecasting - Adithyaa

# INTRODUCTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>

This directory contains a Jupyter Notebook designed for load forecasting analysis using the UK DALE dataset. The notebook includes all necessary code for data preprocessing, analysis and model development. The dataset used for this project is not included in the repository. To execute the code, users must download the UK DALE dataset from the UKERC website [here](https://ukerc.rl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dataDiscover.pl?Action=detail&dataid=7d78f943-f9fe-413b-af52-1816f9d968b0&STerm=UK-DALE&SScope=&GoAct=&AFull=4&AllFilters=&RandKey=&TotHead=TOTHEAD), and upload it to their Google Drive.

The notebook is self-contained with step-by-step instructions to guide users through the process of linking their Google Drive, loading the dataset and running the analysis.

# RECOMMENDED LIBRARIES:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>

numpy: Provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

pandas: Offers data structures and functions needed to efficiently manipulate structured data such as DataFrames.

datetime: Facilitates operations on date and time objects.

math: Provides basic mathematical functions and constants such as trigonometric and logarithmic operations.

glob: Allows for pattern matching within the file system, useful for reading files with specific naming conventions.

matplotlib: A fundamental plotting library for creating static, animated and interactive visualizations.

seaborn: Builds on Matplotlib to provide a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
